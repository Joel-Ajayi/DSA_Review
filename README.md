# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This workspace contains implementations and learning notes for common data structures and algorithms in Python.

Current focus

- Binary Tree (working directory)

Topics covered already

- Linked Lists (`linkedlist/`) - singly, doubly, circular implementations (`linkedlist.py`, `doublinkedlist.py`, `circularLinkedlIst.py`, `CDLinkedList.py`)
- Queues (`queue_lrn/`) - array-backed and linked-list-backed queues (`list_queue.py`, `linkedList_queue.py`)
- Stacks (`stack/`) - stack implementations (`stack.py`, `linked_stack.py`)

Planned topics (roadmap)

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- AVL Tree
- Trie
- Binary Heap
- Hash Table
- Search Algorithms (linear, binary, jump, interpolation)
- Sorting Algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, heap, counting, radix)
- Graphs (representations, BFS, DFS, shortest paths)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming

Structure

- `linkedlist/` - singly/doubly/circular linked list implementations
- `queue_lrn/` - queue implementations
- `stack/` - stack implementations
- `tree/` - tree implementations (Binary Tree, BST, AVL to be added)
- other scripts and notebooks with examples and exercises

How to use

- Open the file or folder for a specific data structure and run the Python file(s) to see example usage.
- Add tests under a `tests/` folder in the future.

Contributions

- Add implementations, tests, and explanatory notes.
- Keep function/class interfaces stable where possible.

Contact

- This is a personal workspace. Adjust the README as you progress.
